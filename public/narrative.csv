0,0,"Six passengers are on a StellarTransit spaceship, delivering cargo to a distant planet on a year-long journey. Just a week into the trip, the ship's alarm goes off—a deadly creature known as a Xylarian has secretly boarded. The passengers have heard the terrifying stories: Xylarians are shape-shifters that kill and perfectly mimic their victims. Worse, one of the passengers has already been replaced.

The ship's alarm was triggered only after a dead body was found, meaning the Xylarian has been among them since before takeoff. The old StellarTransit  vehicle you fly on  is outdated and wouldn't help identify the imposter, and no one has ever survived an encounter with a Xylarian, so there's little reliable information on how to deal with them.

It's up to you to figure out which one of them is the alien. The challenge? You didn’t know any of the crew before this journey, so you’ll have to rely on sharp observation and intuition. Spotting small inconsistencies is your only chance to uncover the truth before the Xylarian strikes again.
